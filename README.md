Personal Info:
Working full time at Air Menzies International – Freight forwarding company. Currently learning each section of the business to better my chances for promotion and to eventually move into a management position. Looking to study IT to broaden my knowledge base and to be more employable and valuable within a team that may lack IT knowledge. I hope to one day be in IT sales and/or a representative for a team who may lack leadership or charisma – to help convey important technological advances enabling me to be the link between the brains and the ‘front office’ of a company.

<bold> Interest in IT:

My interest in IT has been an extensive hobby and fascination of mine. Since I was young, I was intrigued with games, operations and transfer of data which was all made possible through the use of technology. Coupled with the ability to now study remotely – RMIT was the front runner for me to study this degree as my two of my cousins have studied a Bachelor’s of Information Technology and held RMIT to a very high standard for both theory and practical aspects throughout. I am fascinated by the potential advantages that IT can have on a business and/or personal circumstances as well as automation of tasks to save time, increase efficiency and boost profits/free time – depending on the purpose.

IT Experience:

I have little to no Experience in an IT role as I have never been placed in a team which practices such. In most work places that I have worked at – the IT team was qualified and not interested in unqualified people who saw IT as a hobby rather than a profession. Therefore, I was unable to move into the IT field/industry. My IT experience begins and ends in a gaming environment and small amounts of programming to automate certain games and websites.








IDEAL JOB:

Chief Information Officer
 


In my own words – this job would require immense amounts of experience and loyalty to a company as well as hard work and a natural talent in the field. Understandably this job would not be possible for a graduate IT student – this would be a job for a senior IT advisor/ consultant who would benefit from sales experience and boardroom communications. 


This role would require experience in a role equal to or above the before mentioned duties and responsibilities – as this is the top tier IT job for a company – it would be assumed that the successful person has been exposed to this role before applying.


Current Experience:
currently I have little to no IT experience and this degree will be my first attempt at applying IT knowledge into a professional environment. I have basic knowledge of computers and tend to spend a great majority of time operating and using the machines for entertainment/ social media and gaming. However, these hobbies have no helped to gain experience in servicing a company or customers to achieve a common goal.
Plan to obtain Chief Operating Officer position:
As this job role is quite prestigious, rewarding and top tier - any employers looking to hire for this position will be looking for a combination of knowledge, confidence, experience and vision. In order to be competitive for a role like this – it will take years of learning within different positions and grasping every opportunity that may come my way. I plan to move internally through my company until I have obtained experience in multiple roles as well as studying to cover all tertiary education requirements to advance in the IT industry. I am a charismatic person who has a high standard of communication and can build rapport with almost anyone. I plan to use this to my advantage when interviewing and networking within my company – for various roles. After enough time has elapsed, I will endeavour to move up through the company I currently work for using the strong relationships and good reputation I’ve built for myself to ultimately land my dream job of being a Chief Operating Officer.
