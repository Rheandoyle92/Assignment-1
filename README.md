Personal Info:
Working full time at Air Menzies International – Freight forwarding company. Currently learning each section of the business to better my chances for promotion and to eventually move into a management position. Looking to study IT to broaden my knowledge base and to be more employable and valuable within a team that may lack IT knowledge. I hope to one day be in IT sales and/or a representative for a team who may lack leadership or charisma – to help convey important technological advances enabling me to be the link between the brains and the ‘front office’ of a company.
<br />
<bold> Interest in IT:
<br />
My interest in IT has been an extensive hobby and fascination of mine. Since I was young, I was intrigued with games, operations and transfer of data which was all made possible through the use of technology. Coupled with the ability to now study remotely – RMIT was the front runner for me to study this degree as my two of my cousins have studied a Bachelor’s of Information Technology and held RMIT to a very high standard for both theory and practical aspects throughout. I am fascinated by the potential advantages that IT can have on a business and/or personal circumstances as well as automation of tasks to save time, increase efficiency and boost profits/free time – depending on the purpose.
<br />
IT Experience:
<br />
I have little to no Experience in an IT role as I have never been placed in a team which practices such. In most work places that I have worked at – the IT team was qualified and not interested in unqualified people who saw IT as a hobby rather than a profession. Therefore, I was unable to move into the IT field/industry. My IT experience begins and ends in a gaming environment and small amounts of programming to automate certain games and websites.

IDEAL JOB:

Chief Information Officer
 
<br />

In my own words – this job would require immense amounts of experience and loyalty to a company as well as hard work and a natural talent in the field. Understandably this job would not be possible for a graduate IT student – this would be a job for a senior IT advisor/ consultant who would benefit from sales experience and boardroom communications. 
<br />
<br />
This role would require experience in a role equal to or above the before mentioned duties and responsibilities – as this is the top tier IT job for a company – it would be assumed that the successful person has been exposed to this role before applying.


Current Experience:


currently I have little to no IT experience and this degree will be my first attempt at applying IT knowledge into a professional environment. I have basic knowledge of computers and tend to spend a great majority of time operating and using the machines for entertainment/ social media and gaming. However, these hobbies have no helped to gain experience in servicing a company or customers to achieve a common goal.

<br />

Plan to obtain Chief Operating Officer position:
<br />
As this job role is quite prestigious, rewarding and top tier - any employers looking to hire for this position will be looking for a combination of knowledge, confidence, experience and vision. In order to be competitive for a role like this – it will take years of learning within different positions and grasping every opportunity that may come my way. I plan to move internally through my company until I have obtained experience in multiple roles as well as studying to cover all tertiary education requirements to advance in the IT industry. I am a charismatic person who has a high standard of communication and can build rapport with almost anyone. I plan to use this to my advantage when interviewing and networking within my company – for various roles. After enough time has elapsed, I will endeavour to move up through the company I currently work for using the strong relationships and good reputation I’ve built for myself to ultimately land my dream job of being a Chief Operating Officer.

Project Idea
<br />
Freight log
<br />
Overview: 
<br />
Freight log is a program in which a company could download on all computers attached to the same
VPN network. This program allows instant data transfer from PC to PC as well as from PC to Customs
agency and also Biosecurity. The reason why instant data transfer is incredibly important is so that
operators have the ability to check release status and have information at the ready to advise
customers if required. Also, to file for an Export Declaration Number, Transshipment number or Consolidation Reference Number which is currently entered manually and all fields are filled out and submitted manually to an email address – this will streamline the process and allow for increased efficiency and accuracy.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Motivation:
<br />
The motivation behind a program like freight log for me is to drastically increase efficiency and to also create a permanent passive database of information which can then be exported and displayed in a user-friendly view. A large part of the motivation behind this kind of project stems from the daily struggle of not having a system like this whilst working as a freight forwarder. From the beginning of working at the company that I do – I have always had a vision to automate and go paperless. I believe a program like this would rocket the company in the right direction.
<br />

Description


Menu:

This program will have a very simple to read and navigate main menu user interface with the below headings and destinations:

-	Imports – Leads to Folio (consolidation) and HAWB (House Bill processing). There will also be an invoicing section in this sub header which will allow the user to process any Import related jobs.

-	Exports: Leads to consolidation and job processing – this is where the operators can cut and print docs/ labels. There is also an invoicing option for any Export related jobs.

-	Quotation Tab: In this tab you can generate import or export quotes by using a screen which allows you to key through the relevant fields with a description of what will need to be entered into text box. The text boxes will auto fill with information like – Correct airport IATA Codes – correct weight breaks and volumetric size of the shipment. This will also select the higher weight – either actual weight or volume by using in built formulas in the back end of the program.

-	Maintenance Tab: Within this tab management can make amendments to any export or import jobs that have been incorrectly processed. They can also reinvoice or credit particular jobs. Once jobs are invoiced correctly, they can be sent Directly from Freight Log to the customer by keeping the company customer database up to date with correct emails/phone numbers.

-	Customer Data Base Tab: Within this tab the company will continuously use the online database to keep track of customers, sales leads and all potential change of company name/ employee change and particular goal markers for each customer/group of customers.

-	Troubleshooting: in this tab the developers can enable or disable particular error codes or gateways that have to be completed before moving to another step. This will help with the accuracy of documents or entries to the customs agency which allows for the import or export of freight. The program does not allow spelling mistakes – within the troubleshooting tab the developers can enable or disable words that will create an error code – to allow for particular customer codes that would not be recognized within the English dictionary.



Tools and Technologies

To compliment this program, I would set up rules within outlook email to filter responses –
Rejections/accepted Shipments to be directed to a specific folder which are filed once read, in an
easy to reference location and/or shared mailbox. The only other tool that will be required for this program to work will be – a VPN, an internet connection, a printer and a label printer which is also connected to the same network.



Skills required

The skills required in order to operate this program are very minimal – It only requires a basic understanding of freight forwarding to help navigate around the program, and to complete the import or export operations through this program. The program gives prompts and error codes depending on what is specified by the developers. This is not only a program for developers but it is for the population of the company – young or old, IT professional or warehouse operator. The small skill gate on this program allows it to be teachable within a matter of days – and with more practice the staff will become proficient with the program to push effectiveness and accuracy to the limits.



Outcome

With success, the outcome will be to increase overall efficiency, profits and work ethic. This will also increase accuracy to limit wrong processing of docs or credits required. Along with efficiency, the company will be able to keep a closer eye on sales targets and the customer database to be able to prioritize customer needs and customer rate files (to allow special rate agreements).
