Personal Info:
Working full time at Air Menzies International – Freight forwarding company. Currently learning each section of the business to better my chances for promotion and to eventually move into a management position. Looking to study IT to broaden my knowledge base and to be more employable and valuable within a team that may lack IT knowledge. I hope to one day be in IT sales and/or a representative for a team who may lack leadership or charisma – to help convey important technological advances enabling me to be the link between the brains and the ‘front office’ of a company.
